### Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am an experienced finance professional turned web developer based in the Berlin area.

I am also a fairly untalented blues gutarist and songwriter, but this probably isn't the place for that! :notes: ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ :notes:

#### I recently completed an intensive web development bootcamp at Ironhack Berlin and I'm looking to bring my skills knowledge, creativity and desire to learn to a team in the Berlin area.
